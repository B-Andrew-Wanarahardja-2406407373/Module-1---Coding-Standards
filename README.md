Reflection 1
There are multiple ways clean code can be implemented. 
The Ones i tried to implement were less comments, and variable naming thing. 
The variable naming thing i did where i tried to keep the names uniform, always "productId" in the ones where it's needed.
Another place i did that was in the edit branch where i had to physically stop myself from using the variable name "i" for the for-loop and use "repoIndex" instead.
As for less comments, i think they're already clear enough to not to need comments, which is the point 
So far, i haven't seen any mistakes in the source code yet.
